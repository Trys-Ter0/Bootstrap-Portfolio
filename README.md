# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description 

A developer's portfolio is not just a showcase of their skills and projects; it is also an expression of their design ethos. The novice developer's ability to use the medium to effectively articulate that ethos is strongly tested by the freedom to do whatever they want with their site. Thankfully, I was tasked with creating a portfolio site using Bootstrap and including particular features such as a jumbotron with an image and hover effects on links.
